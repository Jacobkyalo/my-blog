## Introduction

This article provides an overview of how to initialize a repository under Git version control. It will walk you through initializing a Git repository for a new or existing project. It will also guide you in cloning existing remote repositories from Github. This guide assumes a basic familiarity with a command-line interface like Git Bash.

If you have a project directory that is currently not under version control and you want to start controlling it with Git, you first need to go to that projectâ€™s directory and initialize Git in that project. Furthermore if you have a git repository hosted remotely or you want to collaborate on a project hosted remotely on Github, you have to clone it to your local machine as discussed below.

## Initializing a Git repository

To initialize a Git repository in an existing or a new project, run the following command in Git Bash

```bash
git init
```

This command will create a _.git_ directory with all Git configurations (folders and files) that will help you in version-controlling your project files. You don't need to worry about these Git folders and files for now.

After initializing a Git repository you can now start adding files to the staging area using git command, _git add_ and also committing changes to the local repository using git command, _git commit_.

## Cloning an existing repository

When a project is hosted in a central or remote repository, the _git clone_ command can be used by other users to obtain a local development copy of repository. This helps get a local working copy.

_git clone_ command creates a local copy or clone of remote repositories. To clone a remote repository you pass a remote URL(Universal Resource Locator) to _git clone_ command.For example

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jacobkyalo/my-blog.git
```

You can perform a shallow clone of the remote repository while eliminating extensive commit history by adding _-depth=1_ flag to the git clone command as:

```bash
git clone -depth=1 https://github.com/Jacobkyalo/my-blog.git
```

You can also clone a specific branch without cloning the remote _HEAD_ branch as follows

```bash
git clone --mybranch https://github.com/Jacobkyalo/my-blog.git
```

## Conclusion

That's it, you can now initialize Git and clone remote repositories.
The above _git clone_ commands are the most used ones but there are other git clone commands in the official [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone).

Happy version-controlling!
